# gaussianprocessworkshop

for everything to work out fine you could create a new conda environment like this: 

 `conda create --name gpworkshop python=3 numpy matplotlib scipy ipython jupyter

activate it: 

`source activate gpworkshop`

and then call 

  `jupyter notebook`
  
 in the code directory.
